In the recent days, a lot of AI LLM models release their newest versions almost every day. Grok rolled on its third iteration `Grok-3`, Claude released so-called the strongest physical calculation AI model `sonnet 3.7`,  and DeepSeek has its name remembered for its breakthrough open-source AI model. It seems like numerous technology companies join the competitive races and everyone ends up having a dozen of free or charged LLMs at hand. Has the age of AI arrived? Yes, it is.

In this scenario, I've just finished reading the book **Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI** written by Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari.  This book prompts me to think wider and deeper about the AI.

There are some important and interesting points in this book. After summarizing those points, I'd like to talk about my feelings of the threat and challenges AI brings to us.

## Important points in Nexus

### AI is better than humans to make up myths



### AI is also fallible





## Challenges and hope

### Is it possible to train a nice and responsible AI

 

### Data privacy



### Questions whose answers we never know
