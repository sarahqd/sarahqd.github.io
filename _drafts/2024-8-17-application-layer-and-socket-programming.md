As an application developer, I don't deal with protocols too much.  Protocols of computer networking seem to be matured and prepared on a common PC system. I just connect the network and use it. But the principles and logic at the background are so charming that it deserves our attention to know a bit more.

Protocols are the basics of computer networking.  Yes, they are. With standard communication formats and methods, people connect with others from other continents in the world. Without those protocols,  just imagine that a chicken tried to talk with a duck. 

In this blog, I'd like to scan about protocol layers, and focus on the application layer protocols and transport layer protocols TCP/UDP, finally work on some simple socket programming examples to look into what happened when we click a link on a webpage.

## Protocol layers

There are five layers on an end device.
