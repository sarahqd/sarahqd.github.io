Are you afraid of public speaking? Would you like to talk to a stranger comfortably? Many experts<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup> have summarized effective methods to help us be a better presenter.<!--more-->

This blog won't talk about how to talk in humor or with passion, but the basic principles behind  a good representation and how to make a representation simpler for everyone.

There are three main strategies that could help you do a presentation easily: focus on others, ask open-ended questions and be clear.

## Focus on others

We incline to focus on ourselves while talking with others.  Am I doing well？ Are the audiences judging me?  What if I forget my words suddenly and stand there like an idiot?  All of those questions degrade our presentation.

Focus on others, your clients or your audiences.  Change the questions like this: what do the audiences need? what can I help them? what will impact the audiences deeply?  By focusing on others, we do everything to help our audiences feel relaxed and happy to hear our talking.  Also, you relax at the same time while you're not the center of this presentation but your audiences are.

Some persons work well with one or a couple of audiences, but feel nervous in a public occasion with large groups of people.  There are too many people to focus. What shall we do? Just keep eye-contact with one person for a couple of sentences<sup>[2]</sup>.  Focus one person at once a time. 

## Ask open-ended questions

You shall ask questions if you'd like to know more about others. Closed-ended questions come with a shallow answer.

"When will the meeting begin?" "9:00 a.m."

Open-ended questions generate more words and create a chance to continue the conversation.

"Why do you want to work here?" "I was interesting in .... This company is ..."

The above graph provides a bunch of words to create a closed-ended question or an open-ended question. When do we use closed-ended questions or open-ended questions? It depends. 

Asking open-ended questions takes risks into an unknow field.  So ask more open-ended questions and you'll find something amazing.

## Be clear
